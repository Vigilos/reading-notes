# Reading: Data Structures and Algorithms

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

   Especially when dealing with large amounts of stored data, it is important to take into consideration the time complexities of data operations associated with each type of data structure (i.e. the Big-O).

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

There must be at least one "achievable" branch (i.e. a base case) that does not make a recursive call.

## Things I want to know more about

I am interested in digging further into the science behind Big-O.
