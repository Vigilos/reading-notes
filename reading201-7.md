# Reading: Class 7 - Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.

   Domain modeling allows a programmer to better articulate, verify and validate a given problem.

## HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

   - It reduces accessibility
   - Can make the markup structure a mess that is hard to understand
   - There can be complications regarding the with of table elements

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML \<table>.

   - \<th> - Denotes a table header that can be used to describe/name a row or column
   - \<tr> - Declare a table row, which contain \<td>'s
   - \<td> - Denotes table data, whre content of the table is place (aka a cell)

## Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

   Constructors are similar to function except they allow you to create new objects and their names start with a capital letter.

2. How does the term _this_ differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

   The term _this_ gets bound to the new object, allowing it to be referred to in the contructor code.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience (NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question).

   Prototypes are like a clone of an objects structure, allowing for the store of data or methods in the prototype that is then accessible by all objects created from the same prototype, through what is called inheritance.

## Things I want to know more about

I need to spend more time researching the prototype and constructor concepts.
