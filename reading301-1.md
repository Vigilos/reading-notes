# Reading: Class 1 - Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture

1. What is a “component”?

   "A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface." [^1]

2. What are the characteristics of a component?

   - Reusability
   - Replaceable
   - Not context specific
   - Extensible
   - Encapsulated
   - Independent

3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

   It can save time (and money) to utilize component architecture, as it is a reliable way to repurpose, maintain, and deploy self-contained constructs that provide a function for the system.

## What is Props and How to Use it in React?

1. What is “props” short for?

   Properties

2. How are props used in React?

   Props are used to pass data between components in React, like arguments for a function.

3. What is the flow of props?

   The flow is unidirectional, from parent components to child components, and is also read-only.

## Things I want to know more about

There is not more I'd like to know. I just want to try it in action now.
