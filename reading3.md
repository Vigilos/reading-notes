# Reading 3 - Git: Revisions and the Cloud

- Git Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS)
- GitHub is a sharable repository of Git files, stored on the Internet (i.e. the cloud)
- When working with a local repository, changes to files must be synchronized between the local and cloud repositories, to avoid conflicts (e.g. “gituations”)
  - Add.Commit.Push (ASP) & Pull
  - GitHub repositories can be cloned to a local storage device
- All changes to files are logged and can be revisited in GitHub
  - Old version can be reverted to
