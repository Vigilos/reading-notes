# Reading: Class 14 - Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

   PCs started becoming a norm in the homes.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

   It made them more likely to be drawn to the computer industry, and gave them a potential advantage in understanding basic computer terminology and technology. However, females had equal access to those home computers. They possibly had different priorities and interests than the males, and that is not a problem. Men and women, boys and girls, should be free to follow whatever interests they may have, regardless of gender.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

   According to the article: When they are "driven by a commitment by the company leaders." My seventeen years in the industry and thirty, plus, years in business tells me that it is most successful when job position standards are lowered, gender hiring bias is eliminated from the process, and employee acquisition occurs naturally.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

   According to the article: "Diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones." Even the article states that there is not enough data to prove this hypothesis. However, again in my experience across multiple organizations, diversity (and not just gender diversity) on a team can increase the chances of thinking outside the organizational "box" and bring more creative solutions to the table.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

   It can be helpful to have a company (especially those working in "human factors," human engineering, or UX design) have a diversity tha matches with the target customer demographic, as the application/technology can best be designed and presented to reduce barriers to access, as well as increase market appeal. One challenge here, though, is that hiring for that target demographic, to gain this advantage, may result in a not-so-diverse company.

## Things I want to know more about

There is a lot of research and thought that should be done in this area, that goes beyond simple, and sometimes short-sighted, American political correctness. It is worth studying further.
