# Reading 7 – Programming with JavaScript

- Control Flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script
- Functions allow you to reuse code, by defining once and using it many times

```javascript
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
  }’
  ‘let x = myFunction(4, 3);
// Function is called, return value will end up in x

function myFunction(a, b) {
return a \* b; // Function returns the product of a and b
}’
```

- Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function
- Local variables can only be accessed from within the function
