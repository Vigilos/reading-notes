# Reading: Class 4 - HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Creating Hyperlinks

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

   The element that is use is \<a>.

2. The href attribute contains what information?

   The uniform resource locator (URL), like the web address, of the link's target.

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

- Ensure to put content in between the \<a> and \</a> tags
- Use the _title_ attribute in the element to provide addtional information about the link

## Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?

   It is the way elements are layout out and displayed if there is no CSS styling applied.

2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

- Block-level: Fills the available inline space of its parent container
- Inline: Is only the size of the content itself and resides inside content of block-level elements

3. \_\_\_ positioning is the default for every html element.

   Status position (i.e. put the element in its normal postion in the document flow)

4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

- The element no longer exists in the document flow (i.e. sits on its own layer)
- The element can be placed in an absolute position related to proscribed distances from the edge of the containing elements sides

5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

   Absolute positions relative to the sides of its parent container, while fixed positions realtive to the visible portion of the viewport.

## JS Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

- Declaration: The code in the function is read by the system and ready to be executed
- Invocation: The function is call and the statements inside it are executed

2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

   Parameters are are the names of data that is passed into a function at the time of invocation. Arguments are the actual values passed in those paramters.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

- Learning from fellow students - There is always more to learn and you never know what ideas your co-programmer may come up with, even is they have less experience
- Work environment readiness - Getting practice successfully pair programming will prepare me for future jobs
