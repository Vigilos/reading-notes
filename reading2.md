# Reading 2 - The Coder’s Computer (Text Editors)

I have been programming since the mid-1980’s (i.e. the dark ages). I love where editors are today. I started coding with line editors in CPM, Unix and DOS, such as EDLIN. The auto-correct/complete features that we started seeing in MS Visual Studio in the 1990’s and what they have grown into today makes life so much easier, as we have moved from basic text editors to full-featured IDEs.
