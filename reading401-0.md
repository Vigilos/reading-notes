# Reading: Engineering

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

   I have over 17 years in the information technology industry, to include several of those years in software development. I have led software development from the team leader to the chief operating officer levels. I also bring to the table experience from multiple other disciplines, to include entrepreneurism, government sector, financial sector, law enforcement, and the military.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

   - Use pseudo-coding to "talk out" what needs to be accomplished
   - Fill in sections that needed to be coded with commenting, describing what is to go in that section
   - Seek out possible answers through online searches

## Things I want to know more about

I'm always looking for new ideas for first tackling (planning, first steps, etc.) new programming projects.
