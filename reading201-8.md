# Reading: Class 8 - CSS Flexbox

## CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

   It only deals with layout in a single direction at a time (columns or rows).

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

   The main axis is the axis set by the _flex-direction_ property and would be row or column. The cross axis would then be the other option (column or row).

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

   Since flexbox children may not follow the logical order of HTML, they may not be easily accessible, as intended, to those who are using screen readers or navigating via keyboard (e.g. when the _row-reverse_ value is used).

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

   With floats we can only items left or right, but using flexbox we can modify our models in all four directions. [^1]

2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

   It gives me so much more flexibility for designing web page layout, reducing the time it takes to create a page's layout.

## Things I want to know more about

I'm looking forward to using a flexbox on my next project.
