## About Me
I have been programming since the third grade, learning hexadecimal and binary right alongside decimal as a young kid. I programmed in several languages over the years, to include Assembly/Machine Code, Pascal, Visual Basic for Application, Java, and Python. However, the information technology require recency. Thus, I am here brushing up on my skillset and learning what's new in the industry of software development. :smile:

## Class Notes
#### Growth Mindset
Growth Mindset is a method for articulating a progressive means of acquiring and using knowledge. In incorporates a positive view that rejects stagnation during the learning process and embraces a "Can Do / Will Do" methodology.

3 reminders for growth mindset

- In order to achieve success, it helps to be willing to contiuously learn new things 
- One learns best through failing and overcoming those failures
- As they say in a hacker class I took, "_Try harder_" - Believe you can, seek out the answers and don't be afraid to ask for help
