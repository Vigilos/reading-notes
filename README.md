## About Me

I have been programming since the third grade, learning hexadecimal and binary right alongside decimal as a young kid. I programmed in several languages over the years, to include Assembly/Machine Code, Pascal, Visual Basic for Application, Java, and Python. However, the information technology require recency. Thus, I am here brushing up on my skillset and learning what's new in the industry of software development. :smile:
