# Reading: Class 7 - REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

   He is one of the authors of the web. He helped write the first web servers and did a lot of research explaining how the web works.

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

   Protocols had not yet been written for such a large number of computer to interact on the same network, at the sem time.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

   It is a method, or set of rules, by which it is possible for a large number of computer to share the same network, and know how to talk to and reference each other.

4. What does a GET do?

   It retrieves something from another server via http.

5. What does a POST do?

   It sends/submits/adds something to another server via http.

6. What does PUT do?

   It does a update/replacement to another server via http.

7.What does PATCH do?

It does a partial update/replacement to another server via http.
