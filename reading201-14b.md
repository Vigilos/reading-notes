# Reading: Class 14b - What Google Learned About Building Perfect Teams

## My Summary of the Reading

Having an "good" team can make all the difference for team effectiveness and team member morale. The study done at Google, on how to build the perfect team, showed that it was not so much the intelligence, skills, or motivation of the team members that made it successful, but the emotional intelligence shown between members that really mattered.[^1] Consistent and accepted team norms, equal-talking amongst members, and members intuiting how their teammates felt during interactions all worked together to create a feeling of "psychological safety" within the team and increased team success with their projects. It comes down to how a the team members feel about being on the team (i.e. happy, relaxed, energized vs. sad, stressed, exhausted) that makes for a "perfect" team. While leadership plays a role, the team members need to all be onboard the team to be successful in this way.

## Things I want to know more about

I'm curious to know what other tech companies have utilized Google's research on this topic.
